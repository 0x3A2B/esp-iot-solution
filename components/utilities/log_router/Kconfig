    config LOG_ROUTER_BUFFER_SIZE
        int "Buffer size (bytes)"
        range 2048 10240
        default 4096
        help
            Size of the buffer used for log buffering.
            Larger buffer reduces flash write frequency but uses more RAM.
            Range: 2KB (2048) to 10KB (10240)

    config LOG_ROUTER_FLUSH_THRESHOLD_PERCENT
        int "Flush threshold percentage"
        range 50 90
        default 75
        help
            Percentage of buffer size at which to trigger a flush.
            Higher percentage means more data buffered before writing to flash.
            Range: 50% to 90%

    config LOG_ROUTER_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS
        int "Flush timeout (milliseconds)"
        range 2000 10000
        default 2000
        help
            Maximum time to wait before flushing buffer to flash.
            Shorter timeout ensures more frequent writes but may reduce performance.
            Range: 2 seconds (2000ms) to 10 seconds (10000ms)

    config LOG_ROUTER_FORMAT_BUFFER_SIZE
        int "Log format buffer size (bytes)"
        range 256 1024
        default 256
        help
            Size of the buffer used for formatting log messages in log_router.
            Larger buffer can handle longer log messages but uses more stack space.
            Range: 256 to 1024 bytes

    config LOG_ROUTER_DEBUG_OUTPUT
        bool "Enable debug output"
        default y
        help
            Enable debug output for log router operations.
            When enabled, printf statements will show buffer flush events,
            timeout triggers, and error conditions.
            Disable this in production to improve performance.
